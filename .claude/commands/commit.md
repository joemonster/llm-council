Commit all changes and push to origin. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to see what files have changed
2. Run `git diff --stat` to see the scope of changes
3. Run `git log --oneline -3` to see recent commit style
4. Add all changes with `git add -A`
5. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes
6. Push to origin with `git push`

Use the standard commit message format with the Claude Code footer.
